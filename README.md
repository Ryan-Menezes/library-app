## Settings
Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/) installed on your machine and through your terminal enter the project directory and run the command "npm update":
```sh
cd "project directory"
npm update
```
After that make sure that [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is installed on your machine and run the command "mongod" in a separate terminal to start the mongo server:
```sh
mongod
```
Rename the .env.example file to .env<br><br>
Finally, start the node.js server with the command "npm start" in a separate terminal:
```sh
cd "project directory"
npm start
```
Important: this project is an example of using an api developed by me. it must be running separately for the project to work correctly.
